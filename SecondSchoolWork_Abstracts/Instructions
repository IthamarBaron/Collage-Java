Define a base class Shape with abstract methods calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter(). Create subclasses Circle, Square, and Rectangle that inherit from Shape and implement these methods appropriately.
In the Circle class, calculate area and perimeter using the formulas πr² and 2πr, respectively.
In the Square class, calculate area and perimeter using the formula side² for both.
In the Rectangle class, calculate area and perimeter using the formulas length * width and 2 * (length + width), respectively.
Create instances of each shape class and call their calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter() methods to demonstrate their functionality.
